  <h2>Unit 6 Project: Turtle Programming “Scene”</h2>
  <p class=box>I have learned many new skills: how to make an app, how to use turtle programming to draw a “scene,” how to make a game, and how to make my own website.
    I have a goal of creating/coding a website to launch a ceramics website for my ceramic pieces.
    This course has taught me that I can create anything using coding.
    I've noticed that I often start with big ideas and plans for my projects, but in the end, I tend to simplify them quite a bit.
    Turtle programming is an area of weakness for me, but I can improve in this area by continuing to practice using turtle.
  Below is my "scene."</p>
