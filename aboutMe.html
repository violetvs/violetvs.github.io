  <h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="images/aboutMeImage.JPG" alt="picture of me">
<h2>Hello, my name is Violet!</h2>
<p class=box>I enjoy baking, in particular experimenting with gluten-free and refined sugar-free recipes.
  I also enjoy making ceramics, reading, sleeping, going to the beach, hanging out with friends, making matcha, swimming, and running.
  The purpose of my portfolio is to observe the growth of my journey in computer science.
  I have learned so much about the world of computer science and how it is being used in many different areas of our lives every day.
  From our phones to life-saving inventions, we see computer science being utilized everywhere.
  In this class, I have had obstacles and difficulties in some areas, such as turtle programming.
  But, I have learned to experiment and ask others for help to guide me in the right direction.</p>
