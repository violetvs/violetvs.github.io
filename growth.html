    <h2>Unit 5: "Buzzfeed Style" Recommendation App</h2>
    <p class=box>While making the recommendation app, I actually enjoyed the process and took creative liberty.
  When looking back on previous units, I saw the projects as tasks rather than learning experiences.
  The BuzzFeed project showed me how to show my creativity and imagination through computer science.
  I put in my maximum effort to design the app, and the outcome surpassed anything I could have pictured.
  In earlier units, some hard areas to master were the Boolean expressions and most of the code in turtle programming.
  The turtle programming scene was most difficult for me because I had trouble ordering the code correctly, resulting in a faulty scene.
  I got past this obstacle by watching videos about turtle programming to familiarize myself more with how to align the code so the layers would be properly shown.
  Knowing what I know now, I would change how I view computer science.
  Previously, I saw it as boring and challenging. Now, I can see it is the opposite.
  It can be very enjoyable if you use it to solve a problem or build something you love.
  Also, it is not as challenging as it may seem. Once you know the basics, the rest is straightforward.
Below is my app, click run to play around with my creation.</p>
