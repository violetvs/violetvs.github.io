  <h1>Best Work | Violet Sitkevich</h1>
  <h2>Unit 2 Project, My Website - Matcha Magic</h2>
  <p class=box>I used the knowledge of HTML and styling with CSS to make this work.
  This piece represents my best work because I had the freedom to customize it and express my creative vision fully.
  One of the aspects I take the most pride in is the design's visual appeal.
  I considered what would attract me to a website and aimed to reflect that in my creation.
  The standout feature of this work is the selection of images I incorporated into the gallery.
  The images entice the consumer to continue exploring the website.</p>
